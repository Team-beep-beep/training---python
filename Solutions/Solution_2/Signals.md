# Signals

## input_signal.bin
- fs = 441000 Hz
- Bandwidth = 44100 Hz
- Normalized by bandwidth (no 2pi)
- The signal is centered around 176400 Hz.
- The signal was created using scipy's "resample_poly" so there's edge phenomena from its filter.

## extracted_channel.bin
- fs = 44100 Hz
- Normalized by fs (no 2pi)

## demodulated_signal.bin
- contains the easter egg

## easter_egg.bin
- very short
