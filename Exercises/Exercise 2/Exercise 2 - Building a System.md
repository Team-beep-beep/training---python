# Exercise 2 - Building a System

## Exercise Description

You will receive:

- An input signal with a given bandwidth, sampled at a specified frequency. The input signal is FM-modulated.
- An Easter egg signal which was planted in the input signal, sampled at a specified frequency. The Easter egg signal is **not** modulated.

**Goal:**  
The system should find the Easter egg signal within the input signal.

---
## Before you start
- How will the system work? What will it consist of?

## What You Need to Do

- Write a **short design document** explaining your approach.
- Divide the system into **modules**.
- Implement a **simple multi-stage system**.
- Use **configuration files** to manage parameters.
- Write **tests** to verify your implementation.

## Questions for You

- Where would you add a new processing stage without breaking existing code?
- What is the responsibility of each module?

---

## Code Review (CR) Focus Points

- Proper project structure.
- Clear function design.
- Ease of extensibility.
- Use of coding conventions.
- Code readability.
- Organized work with Git.
