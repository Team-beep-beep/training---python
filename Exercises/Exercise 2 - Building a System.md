# Exercise 2 - Building a System

## Exercise Description

You will receive:

- A one-dimensional input signal with a given bandwidth, sampled at a specified frequency. The input signal is FM-modulated.
- A one-dimensional reference signal, sampled at a specified frequency. The reference signal is **not** modulated.

**Goal:**  
The system should find the reference signal within the input signal.

---

## What You Need to Do

- Write a **short design document** explaining your approach.
- Divide the system into **modules**.
- Implement a **simple multi-stage system**.
- Use a **configuration file** to manage parameters.
- Write **tests** to verify your implementation.
- Submit your solution as a **separate Git repository**.

---

## Questions for You

- Where would you add a new processing stage without breaking existing code?
- What is the responsibility of each module?

---

## Code Review (CR) Focus Points

- Test signal data will be provided upon request.
- Proper project structure.
- Clear function design.
- Ease of extensibility.
- Use of coding conventions.
- Code readability.
- Organized work with Git.
