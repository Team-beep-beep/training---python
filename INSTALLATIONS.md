# Installations

You should install the following tools before starting your work.

---

## Git

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes and collaborate on code.

- Install Git from the official site: https://git-scm.com/downloads  
- You can use Git from the command line (Git Bash on Windows) or a GUI client.  
- Popular Git clients:  
  - **Git Bash** (command line)  
  - **GitKraken** (GUI) — https://www.gitkraken.com/  
- Choose the tool you feel most comfortable with.  
- *Tip:* I personally prefer working with **GitKraken** for its user-friendly interface.

#### GitKraken
- Install GitKraken from https://www.gitkraken.com/  
- Sign in using your GitHub account.  
- Go to https://github.com/settings/applications and under **GitKraken**, grant access to the training repository.  
- Now you should be able to clone the repo from GitKraken using the repository URL.

## Python

Python is the programming language we will use.

- Download and install Python 3.11.9 from: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
- Make sure to check the option **“Add Python to PATH”** during installation (Windows).  
- To verify installation, open your terminal or command prompt and run:  
  ```bash
  python --version

## PyCharm

PyCharm is the IDE (code editor) we use mostly.
(There's also the commonly used Jupyter notebook, but we'll stick to PyCharm for now.)

- Download PyCharm Community Edition (free) from: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/  
- Install and open PyCharm.
