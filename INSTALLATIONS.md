# Installations

You should install the following tools before starting your work.

## Git

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes and collaborate on code.

- Install Git from the official site: https://git-scm.com/downloads  
- You can use Git from the command line (Git Bash on Windows) or a GUI client.  
- Popular Git clients:  
  - **Git Bash** (command line)  
  - **GitKraken** (GUI) — https://www.gitkraken.com/  
- Choose the tool you feel most comfortable with.  
- *Tip:* I personally prefer working with **GitKraken** for its user-friendly interface.

## Python

Python is the programming language we will use.

- Download and install Python 3.10 or higher from: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
- Make sure to check the option **“Add Python to PATH”** during installation (Windows).  
- To verify installation, open your terminal or command prompt and run:  
  ```bash
  python --version

PyCharm is the IDE (code editor) we use mostly.
(There's also the commonly used Jupyter notebook which you can use if you prefer it)
